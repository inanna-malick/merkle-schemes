# Recursion Schemes

Type level fixed point as the glue between each layer `f`

```haskell
newtype Fix f = Fix { unFix :: f (Fix f) }
```

Simple example `f`: Cons cell list

```haskell
data ListF a b
  = Cons a b
  | Nil
  deriving (Functor, Foldable, Traversable)

type List a = Fix (ListF a)
```

Simple example list:

```haskell
myList :: List Int
myList = Fix $ Cons 1 $ Fix $ Cons 2 $ Fix Nil 
```

# Working with Fix: cata (fold)

  -> a
cata alg x = alg             -- a
           . fmap (cata alg) -- f a
           . unFix           -- f (Fix f)
           $ x               -- Fix f
```

# Working with Fix: cata (fold) example


Cata in action: folding over a list

```haskell
toList :: forall a.  List a -> [a]
toList = cata alg
  where
    alg :: ListF a [a] -> [a]
    alg Nil             = []
    alg (Cons elem acc) = elem : acc
```

```haskell
> toList myList
[1,2]
```

          $ x              -- a
```

# Working with Fix: ana (unfold) example


```haskell

```

```haskell
> toList $ fromList [1..10]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

todo: test this - wrote late in day, might accidentally reverse list?

# This lets us do some cool stuff!

recap:
```haskell
data DirLayer a = DirLayer { entities :: [(FilePath, FileTreeEntity a)]}

data FileTreeEntity a
  = FileEntity String 
  | DirEntity  a

type DirTree = Fix DirLayer
```

# Working with Fix: anaM (monadic unfold)

```haskell
newtype Fix f = Fix { unFix :: f (Fix f) }

anaM :: (Monad m, Traversable f)
     => (a -> m (f a))
     -> a
     -> m (Fix f)
anaM alg x = do
  fA    <- alg x                  -- m (f a)
  fFixF <- traverse (anaM alg) fA -- m (f (Fix f))

# Hashing a directory tree

```haskell
hashLayer :: DirLayer Hash -> Hash
hashLayer = hash . AE.encode
```

All you need to do is write a function to hash a layer!

```haskell
cata :: Functor f => (f a -> a) -> Fix f -> a

hashDirTree :: DirTree -> Hash
hashDirTree = cata hashLayer
```


---

# Writing a directory tree to disk

```haskell
writeLayer :: DirLayer Hash -> IO Hash
writeLayer layer = do
  let h = hashLayer layer
      path = hashToPath h
  AE.encodeFile path layer -- write dir layer to path
  pure h
```

All you need to do is write a function to write a layer to the store!

```haskell
cataM :: (Monad m, Traversable f) => (f a -> m a) -> Fix f -> m a

writeDirTree :: DirTree -> IO Hash
writeDirTree = cataM writeLayer
```

---

# Reading a directory tree from disk

```haskell
readLayer :: Hash -> IO (DirLayer Hash)
readLayer h = do
  res <- AE.decodeFileStrict (hashToPath h)
  case res of
    Nothing -> fail "hash deref failed"
    Maybe x -> pure x
```

All you need to do is write a function to retrieve a layer from the store!

```haskell
anaM :: (Monad m, Traversable f) => (a -> m (f a)) -> a -> m (Fix f)

readDirTree :: Hash -> IO DirTree
readDirTree = anaM writeLayer
```

# Diffing two DirTrees: the types

We'll use this sum type to represent different kinds of diffs:

```haskell
data Diff = FileModified
          | FileReplacedWithDir
          | DirReplacedWithFile
          | EntityDeleted
          | EntityCreated
  deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
```

We'll be implementing a function with this type - let's define a stub
```haskell
diffDirTrees :: DirTree -> DirTree -> [(FilePath, Diff)]
diffDirTrees = undefined
```

---

# Diffing two DirTrees: entity removed/created 

The case where a `FileTreeEntity` with some name only exists in one map or the other is simple

```haskell
onRemoved, onAdded :: FilePath -> FileTreeEntity DirTree -> [(FilePath, Diff)]
onRemoved path _ = [(path, EntityDeleted)]
onAdded   path _ = [(path, EntityCreated)]
```

---

# Diffing two Dirs: handling conflict

The case where a `FileTreeEntity` exists in both maps is more interesting

```haskell
onConflict :: FilePath
           -> FileTreeEntity DirTree
           -> FileTreeEntity DirTree
           -> [(FilePath, Diff)]

-- named directory exists in both DirTrees: recurse
onConflict path (DirEntity d1) (DirEntity d2) =
  let updatePath (p,x) = (path ++ "/" ++ p, x)
   in updatePath <$> diffDirTrees d1 d2

-- named file exists in both DirTrees: compare
onConflict path (FileEntity f1) (FileEntity f2)
  | f1 /= f2  = [(path, FileModified)]
  | otherwise = []

-- dir replaced with file
onConflict path (DirEntity _) (FileEntity _) = [(path, DirReplacedWithFile)]

-- file replaced with dir
onConflict path (FileEntity _) (DirEntity _) = [(path, FileReplacedWithDir)]

```
---

# Diffing two DirTrees: merging maps

Ok, that's most of the logic specified. Now all we need to do is compare two directories and dispatch on three cases
- a `FileTreeEntity` exists at some path in both directories
- a `FileTreeEntity` exists at some path in only the first directory
- a `FileTreeEntity` exists at some path in only the second directory


We have two `[(FilePath, FileTreeEntity DirTree)]`s that we need to compare. Put another way, we have two `Map FilePath (FileTreeEntity DirTree)`s.

We'll use the excellent tooling in `Data.Map.Merge` to handle comparing entities with matching names.

---

# Diffing two Dirs: putting it all together

```haskell
diffDirTrees :: DirTree -> DirTree -> [(FilePath, Diff)]
diffDirTrees (Dir entities1) (Dir entities2) = join $ Map.elems mergeRes

  where
    mergeRes :: Map FilePath [(FilePath, Diff)]
    mergeRes = Map.merge (Map.mapMissing onRemoved)
                         (Map.mapMissing onAdded)
                         (Map.zipWithMatched onConflict)
                         (Map.fromList entities1)
                         (Map.fromList entities2)
```

TODO: test above code, include example directories and example outputs? -or- use off-screen readDir to go directly from file tree (can visualize easily via `tree` output) to `Dir` which can then be diffed

---

# Example Diff

dir 1:

```
├── README.md (contents: foo)
└── foo
    └── Foo.hs (contents: bar)
```

dir 2:


```
├── README.md (contents: foobar)
└── foo
    └── Bar.hs (contents: bar)
```

result:
```
[ ("README.md", FileModified)
, ("foo/Foo.hs", EntityDeleted)
, ("foo/Bar.hs", EntityCreated)
]
```

todo: more examples

---

Hook for next:
- will add lazy traversal
- hash comparison based shortcutting
- generic versions of DirTree-specific functions
